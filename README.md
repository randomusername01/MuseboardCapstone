## **About the Project**
MuseBoard is a digital whiteboard application designed to help users quickly create and manage boards, which can include visual elements like images and GIFs. It aims to make brainstorming and idea organization more interactive and intuitive, bridging the gap between creativity and productivity.

### **Why MuseBoard?**
Traditional note-taking apps often lack the flexibility to include visual elements seamlessly or provide quick access. MuseBoard addresses these gaps by enabling users to:
- Add pictures and GIFs directly onto boards for enhanced visualization.
- Save and load boards as `.board` files, making it easy to organize and retrieve work.
- Access boards quickly with a clean and responsive interface.
- Use a unique pop-out functionality: an always-available side arrow on the screen allows users to open and hide MuseBoard with a single click, making it faster and more accessible than other note-taking apps.

## **Features**
- **Customizable Boards**: Create, edit, save, and delete boards.
- **Drag-and-Drop Support**: Easily add images or GIFs to boards.
- **Board File Management**: Save boards as `.board` files and open them later.
- **Interactive UI**: Intuitive and visually appealing interface.
- **Offline Access**: Use the application without an internet connection.
